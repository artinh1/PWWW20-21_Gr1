            <label>New Orleans in Trouble?</label>
            <p>The results of medical evaluations performed Monday on New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees revealed that he has multiple rib fractures on both sides of his chest and a collapsed lung on the right side, according to a source.

            Brees is unsure how much time he might be forced to miss before returning to start for the Saints, the source said.

            Brees is suffering from three fractured ribs on his left side and two on the right, possibly more, according to the source. Doctors have cautioned Brees to be especially careful with the damage to his lung.</p>
