			<strong>Can it be discused on who has the best chance at the title for the UFC LightWeight Championship after
			the fight night of UFC-249 which caused lots of upsets in the community?</strong>

				<p> And Ferguson isn't one to shy away from a microphone. He can sell himself and the fight when given the opportunity.
				Ferguson has a great chance to cement his claim to being next in line with a win over Barboza, and no one is talking about it.
				The UFC could be promoting his comeuppance better as a key part of its big fight week.

		<p>The fight was originally supposed to pit Ferguson against No. 3-ranked Khabib Nurmagomedov,
		but an injury forced Nurmagomedov off the card. Regardless, the fight will still be a top-10-level matchup
		with possible title implications.
		</p> 
		
		<p>If Ferguson truly has not reached his peak, then he is a serious threat to dethrone whoever the champion may be after Rafael dos Anjos
		defends against Cerrone on December 19. And when looking at the possible title contenders waiting in line, Ferguson's name stands out already.

		He can sell himself and the fight when given the opportunity. And the money is well above &#36;1,000,000 in terms of ppv's
		Ferguson has a great chance to cement his claim to being next in line with a win over Barboza,

		Even with a week of massive fight after massive fight, do not let this one slip through the cracks.
		You could be witnessing the next UFC lightweight champion of the world in action when Ferguson steps through the
		cage doors at The Ultimate Fighter 22 finale.

		Below we have attached a video of some of the greatest athletic performances the UFC has ever seen from Tony Ferguson, which
		only goes to show as proof how athletic and dedicated he has been to getting the UFC Lightweight title shot he deserves!
