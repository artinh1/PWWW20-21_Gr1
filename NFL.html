			<strong>After weeks of waiting, the National Football League finally released the details of its 2020 regular-season.</strong>
		</p>
		
		<p>It’s the clearest signal yet that the NFL fully intends to start its next season, despite the fact that much of the country is still under
		lockdown orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, other professional leagues like the National Basketball Association and Major League
		Baseball have yet to solidify their plans to return to play after suspending their seasons in March.
		</p> 
		
		<p>The defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs will kick off the year when they host the Houston Texans in a prime-time game on Thursday Night,
		Sept. 10. It will mark the 15th time in the last 17 years the league’s champion opened the year on Thursday Night. 
		</p>
		
		<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, featuring Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski, will open the season against the New Orleans Saints on Sept. 13. The Brady
		effect is already impacting the Bucs, which are scheduled five national games this season, up from only one last year.
		</p>
		
		<p>The post-Eli Manning New York Giants will open the year against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first of two back-to-back Monday Night Football
		games on Sept. 14. Giants offensive coordinator Jason Garrett, the former Dallas Cowboys head coach, will have his first shot at his former team on
		Oct. 11 in Dallas. The NFC East rivals will met for the final time on Jan. 3, 2021.
		</p>
		
		<p>Once again, the Cowboys will be one of the top the NFL with five nationally televised games, including three appearances on NBC’s Sunday Night
		Football telecast. 
		</p>
		
		<p>But despite excitement about the schedule release, many questions still remain if the NFL will start its season on time, as questions surrounding coronavirus remain.
           NFL commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to notify teams of protocols required to be in place by May 15 before practice facilitates open.
		   CNBC obtained a copy of the memo, which says teams must adhere to social distancing guidelines and wearing face masks while in team workplaces. 
		</p>
		
		<p>According to a person close to the league discussions, the NFL recently ensured players in a recent letter to agents they will not be separated
		from families during the season. It said teams would not place players in hotels during the entire season to lower the risk coronavirus infections.
		However, an official from the National Football League Players Association told CNBC the union was unaware of any letter to agents, adding no decision
		has been reached. 
		</p>
		
		<p>Any changes to the NFL schedule or its logistics will need to be presented to the National Football League Players Association’s executive
		committee, before DeMaurice Smith, the union’s executive director, can approve on behalf of players.
