			<strong>What will a title mean in 2020? How will a year of hamstrung stats affect the record books? </strong>
		</p>
		
		<p>This 60-game season will not take place in a bubble city. It will take place in geographical pockets around the country, and each
		team will travel up and down seaboards or through the Heartland dozens of times, getting all too familiar with peculiarities of their
		province before clashing with teams from other regions in a playoff that may never arrive.
		</p> 
		
		<p>Can the owners and labor find common ground and repair their fractured relationship? How might MLB add its voice to the Black Lives Matter
		movement? And honestly, where the hell are the Toronto Blue Jays going to play? 
		</p>
		
		<p>The dog days of summer are usually when even diehard fans tune out for a bit. After four months of rooting hard for your team, it’s easier
		to take a break and rest vocal chords for the push in October. Not this year. We’ve got an all-out sprint on our hands, and despite what the
		writers and radio hosts like to say about the sport’s slow decline, MLB gameplay is actually flourishing at the moment thanks to an abundance
		of young, electrifying talent.
		</p>
		
		<p>A little context: in the eight seasons since MLB expanded its playoff field from eight to 10 clubs, 80 teams have qualified for the postseason
		and their median win total was 93.5. Adjusting for a 60-game season, a record of 34-26 is the 162-game equivalent of going 92-70. So based on the
		historic benchmark of making the playoffs, winning 33 games should keep a team in the mix for the postseason, winning 34 should give them a good
		shot and winning 35 should nearly guarantee a ticket to October.
		</p>
		
		<p>Since the shortened season will be unbalanced and place an emphasis on divisional play (each team will play 10 games apiece against its division,
		40 games in all) and regional interleague play (for example the AL East will play 20 games against the NL East), races across the league should
		be even tighter than usual, and the final standings could end up being decided by a couple of games or even require a tiebreaker or two.
		</p>
		
		<p>The trade deadline, which is only five weeks away, should offer additional intrigue, as more than half the league could possibly still
		be in contention when it arrives.
